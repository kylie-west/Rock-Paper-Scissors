# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game that is played using the browser console. The player is pitted against the computer, which chooses its responses at random. It's best of five, which means the first to 3 victories will be declared the overall winner.

This project comes from the JavaScript Foundations section of The Odin Project.
